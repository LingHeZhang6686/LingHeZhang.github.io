Gene Expression Feature Analysis \& Typing for Five Cancer Types

Research Objective: Address the "curse of dimensionality" in high-dimensional genomic data and screen potential molecular markers for accurate typing of five cancer types (including BRCA, COAD).  

Research Methods: Implemented multi-dimensional dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP), LASSO feature selection, and random forest modeling using R; optimized the matrix operation logic of high-dimensional gene data with C language to enhance computational efficiency in data preprocessing and model training.  

Research Results: Identified 28 key feature genes, achieved 100% cancer typing accuracy (Kappa=1), and detected 68 pairs of highly correlated gene pairs (maximum r=0.993), providing a molecular basis for early cancer diagnosis.  



Automated Iris Species Classification Model

Research Objective: Optimize the inefficiency of traditional manual plant classification and develop a fast, accurate automated identification solution for iris species.  

Research Methods: Completed data preprocessing (deduplication, outlier detection, standardization) using Python, and built logistic regression and decision tree models; developed a lightweight model deployment module with Java to return classification results in real-time after inputting morphological features.  

Research Results: The decision tree model achieved 96.67% test set accuracy, confirmed petal length (importance: 58.2%) and petal width as core features, proposed practical "petal size threshold" classification rules, and the Java deployment module had a response latency of less than 100ms.
